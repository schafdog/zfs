Jörgen Lundman is the principal developer of the ZFS on Apple OS X port.
He works full time as a Unix Engineer at GMO Internet, Tokyo, Japan.
This port would not have been possible without the help of many
others who have contributed their time, effort, and insight.

First and foremost the hard working ZFS developers at Sun/Oracle.
They are responsible for the bulk of the code in this project and
without their efforts there never would have been a ZFS filesystem.

The Apple OS X port was made easier by the great work of ZFS On Linux,
and more information on that project can be found in the 'AUTHORS' file.

  ZFS On Linux by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory


Large parts come from the original work in MacZFS, and the excellent work
of those early developers.

VFS layer and glue comes from the FreeBSD project, who has done a excellent
job connecting the BSD and SYSV kernels together.

The flexible and welcoming attitude toward Open Source by GMO Internet,
Tokyo, Japan has been an integral part of this project.

The book [OS X and iOS Kernel Programming] has been useful when working out
the internals of the newer IOKit section of the Apple OS X kernel. Available
on Amazon.
